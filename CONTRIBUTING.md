# Contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with contributions:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the modules or sample configs in this repository, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new [issue](https://github.com/tinystacks/tinystacks-terraform-modules/issues). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/tinystacks/tinystacks-terraform-modules/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we don’t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. [Install Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

2. If you are an external collaborator, fork the repository.

3. Install or update to **Terraform 1.x**.

4. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to [self-review](/contributing/self-review.md) to speed up the review process:zap:.

#### pre-commit checklist
- [ ] lint

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to link the PR to the appropriate task or issue:
  - Notion task for internal collaborators
  - Github issue for external collaborators
- If you are an external collaborator working from a fork, enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
- As you commit changes to your branch, you should notice checks running and leaving a green checkmark (checks passed) or a red "x" (checks failed).  Make sure all checks have passed.
